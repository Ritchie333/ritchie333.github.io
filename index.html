        <h2>ZX Spectrum Game Disassemblies</h2>
        <p>
        The ZX Spectrum was the best-selling British home computer in the early to mid-1980s.
        As well as having acceptable graphics and sound for games (though not as good as other
        computers such as the Commodore 64 and BBC Micro) it was easy enough to understand and
        program because of the limited hardware and sensible assembler opcodes and instructions
        used by the Z80 processor.
        </p>

        <p>
        The disassemblies have been created using <a href="https://skoolkit.ca">SkoolKit</a>,
        an excellent toolkit for disassembling and documenting ZX Spectrum games written
        by Richard Dymond.    
        </p>

        <p>
        Please note that these disassemblies are possible because the original authors have
        given permission for public sites such as
        <a href="https://worldofspectrum.org">World of Spectrum</a> to download these games,
        so people can enjoy playing them as well as seeing how they worked. <b>I do not
        endorse the disassembly of any games where the copyright has been kept and free
        distribution has been denied.</b>
