<div class="box-title">Screen updates</div>
<div class="paragraph">
There are two copies of the screen, one with the background graphics (stored at <a href="../asm/23296.html">5B00</a>) and one
with moving objects and characters overlaid (<a href="../asm/27392.html">6B00</a>).
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The background buffer is usually left untouched after entering a room (but it can occasionally
be changed, see the routine in <a href="../asm/47147.html">B82B</a>), but the moving objects buffer is updated
continuously as objects move around the screen, by copying the background layer and overlaying
everything in its current position.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
Although this seems slow and redundant, it's not slow enough to make the game unplayable,
and it does solve the requirement of having to write code
that invalidates a specific part of the screen. The routine that puts sprites in the buffer
at <a href="../asm/43069.html">A83D</a> also uses the stack for copying data. This is a
<a href="https://chuntey.wordpress.com/2013/10/02/how-to-write-zx-spectrum-games-chapter-13/">well-known trick</a>
to make graphics updating faster.

<div class="box-title">Miles out of town</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The "out of town" screen at <a href="../asm/61815.html">F177</a> uses a simple 16-bit word at <a href="../asm/61787.html">F15B</a> to store the number of miles walked.
Therefore if you've walked 65,535 miles and walk one more, the counter will reset to 0 and you'll be able
to get back into town in a single move.
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
(Note that 65,535 miles is approximately twice round the circumerence of the Earth.)

<div class="box-title">Shark</div>
<div class="paragraph">
The shark in the sewer is treated as two separate moving objects stacked on top of each other,
with the movement and bounds tables set up to be contiguous.

To see the shark appear to move while sawn in half, try POKE F3A9 , 3
