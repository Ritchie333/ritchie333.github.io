The tune playing at the start of the game is the Colonel Bogey March,
composed by F. J. Ricketts and first published in 1914.

The tune playing when Monty dies is a few bars of the tune Eventide,
commonly known as the hymn Abide with Me, composed by Henry Francis Lyte in 1914.

The character Arthur, and the loading screen graphic, are obvious references
to Arthur Scargill, who was President of the National Union of Mineworkers
when the game was published, during the 1984-85 miner's strike which he was leading.
